# 3. [Greedy Algorithms, Minimum Spanning Trees, and Dynamic Programming](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-greedy?specialization=algorithms)

## Week 1: [Greedy Algorithms](https://github.com/keithpink/algorithms_specialization/blob/main/Greedy_Algorithms_Minimum_Spanning_Trees_and_Dynamic_Programming/greedy.py)

1. **Question: minimize the weighted sum of job completion times**

['jobs.txt'](https://github.com/keithpink/algorithms_specialization/blob/main/Greedy_Algorithms_Minimum_Spanning_Trees_and_Dynamic_Programming/jobs.txt) describes a set of jobs with positive and integral weights and lengths.For example, the third line of the file is "74 59", indicating that the second job has weight 74 and length 59.

  - run the greedy algorithm that schedules jobs in decreasing order of the difference (weight - length). 
  - run the greedy algorithm that schedules jobs (optimally) in decreasing order of the ratio (weight/length)

2. **Question: minimum spanning tree**

['edges.txt'](https://github.com/keithpink/algorithms_specialization/blob/main/Greedy_Algorithms_Minimum_Spanning_Trees_and_Dynamic_Programming/edges.txt) describes an undirected graph with integer edge costs. For example, the third line of the file is "2 3 -8874", indicating that there is an edge connecting vertex #2 and vertex #3 that has cost -8874. You should NOT assume that edge costs are positive, nor should you assume that they are distinct.

Your task is to run Prim's minimum spanning tree algorithm on this graph.
