# 2. [Graph Search Shortest Paths and Data Structures]()

## Week 1: [SCC](https://github.com/keithpink/algorithms_specialization/blob/main/Graph_Search_Shortest_Paths_and_Data_Structures/scc.py)

**Question**: compute the sizes of the 5 largest strongly conncected component(SCCs).

['scc.txt'](https://github.com/keithpink/algorithms_specialization/blob/main/Graph_Search_Shortest_Paths_and_Data_Structures/SCC.txt.zip) contains the edges of a directed graph. Vertices are labeled as positive integers from 1 to 875714. Every row indicates an edge, the vertex label in first column is the tail and the vertex label in second column is the head (recall the graph is directed, and the edges are directed from the first column vertex to the second column vertex)
